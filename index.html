        <h2><span id="icon_snow">❄️</span> snow-container</h2>
        <p>
          Snow forms when water vapor in clouds freezes into ice crystals. Each
          snowflake is unique and falls gently to earth, creating winter's
          magical blanket.

        <h2><span class="icon">🌧️</span> Rain Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          Rain begins when water droplets in clouds become too heavy to stay
          suspended. They fall as precipitation, nourishing plants and refilling
          our water sources.

        <h2><span class="icon">☀️</span> Sunshine & Heat</h2>
        <p>
          The sun provides energy that drives Earth's weather systems. Solar
          radiation heats our planet, creating wind patterns and the water
          cycle.

        <h2><span class="icon">☁️</span> Cloud Formation</h2>
        <p>
          Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools. Water vapor
          condenses around tiny particles, creating the fluffy formations we see
          in the sky.
